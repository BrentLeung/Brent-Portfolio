			<h2>The Project</h2>
			<p>CICTAN-BIOTECH Corporation positions itself as a pioneer in the field of natural health technologies, with a focus on structured water, food science, energy medicine, and natural body care. The company hired me to manage the redesign of its existing website.</p>

			<p>As the project manager for the website I was responsible for overseeing the project from beginning to end, including clarifying the project specifications, selecting a development methodology, developing a schedule to fit the methodology, procuring and managing the development team, overseeing the day-to-day operations, and keeping the project on budget.</p>

					<h2>Project Details</h2>
					<img class="animated fadeInLeft" src="images/dr-he-gant.jpg" alt="Gantt chart">
					<p><span class="bold">Methodology:</span> I selected an iterative method because the company did not have any clear parameters or ideas about how it wanted the new site to look; as such, the website would need to be created one page at a time.</p>
					<p><span class="bold">The Platform:</span> The company would need to make regular updates, and with an in-house IT employee, we decided that a hand-coded site offered the greatest amount of flexibility.</p> 
					<p><span class="bold">Language:</span> Although the company is headquartered in Canada, its main clientele resides in mainland China. As such, the site would need to be bilingual.</p>

				<h2><span class="orange">The Challenges</span></h2>
				<p>The company didn’t have a creative direction in mind when it made the decision to redesign the site. As such, multiple mockups and wireframes had to be completed with very little creative guidance, which meant we spent a lot of time iterating.</p>
				<p>The biggest challenge was balancing what I knew to be industry best practices with project limitations, including budgetary constraints and the convoluted internal approvals process.</p>
				<p>For example, although I strongly recommended implementing effective SEO to the company, its leadership decided to only include a heading tag and descriptive language on the homepage for devices of tablet size and smaller – this was an aesthetic choice.</p>
				<p>Additionally, because content was not predefined, I was constantly coordinating with the writer, the translator, the lead scientist (to approve the accuracy of laymen’s language) and the web designer, all of whom were making constant changes.</p>

					<h2>Impact &amp; Results</h2>
					<p>In light of these challenges, I saw my role as providing the most user-friendly and visually appealing website possible within the client parameters I was given.</p> 
					<p>For example, as a first step, I conducted a content inventory of the original site. The goal was to make navigation easier by grouping related content, identifying and streamline redundant text, and expanding sections that were lacking enough description.</p>
					<p>To ensure smooth day-to-day management of the website, I developed a detailed work plan with timelines and responsibilities for the entire team. I scheduled regular check-ins with all contractors to ensure their work was moving forward and was aligned with the overall strategy, and I also met regularly with the client to secure approval of website mockups, secure necessary assets and clarify site specifications.</p>

				<h2><span class="orange">Reflections</span></h2>
				<p>Although there were challenges in managing the building of this site, the client was very happy with the final product. And although I did not receive approval to implement all of my recommendations, we still created a website that the client was very pleased with based on its ease of navigation, visual appeal, and accurate reflection of its brand. Since the site’s relaunch, the company has received glowing comments on the redesign.</p>
