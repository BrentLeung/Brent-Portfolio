When he approached me about building a new website, he had a clear objective: create a clean-looking website that prominently featured his books and was devoid of extraneous content. He was looking for something simple and clean that utilized a lot of negative space.</p><img class="animated fadeInUp" src="images/jasonCunningham-responsive.jpg" alt="Jason's site seen on a desktop, tablet, and phone"></article><article class="the-process clearfix animatedParent animateOnce" data-appear-top-offset="-300"><h2><span class="orange">The Process</span></h2><div class="process-left divHeight animated fadeInLeft"><img src="images/jason-sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap of Jason's site"></div><div class="process-right divHeight"><h3><span class="orange">The Requirements</span></h3><p>On average, Jason publishes one book a year, so we determined that a hand-coded site would best suit his needs. Additionally, Jason wanted a responsive website that was optimized for search engines.</p><h3><span class="orange">The Challenge</span></h3><p>Not only did the current website lack user experience, but it also failed to prominently display his books, appeal to his target audiences, or link appropriately to his social media channels. The opportunities for a new, improved website were ripe.</p></div></article><article class="the-solution clearfix animatedParent animateOnce" data-appear-top-offset="-400"><h2>The Solution</h2><p>Knowing that the majority of site visitors would be those who were already familiar with Jason’s works, I mocked up a variety of small thumbnails that explored numerous layout possibilities, with each layout featuring his books in different ways.</p><p>These proposals ranged from displaying the books as a metaphor for experimental navigation to a more traditional approach, such as an iBooks layout, and everything in between.</p><img class="animated slow fadeInUp" src="images/jason-3d-mockups.jpg" alt="early design mockups"><p>Ultimately, Jason favoured the idea of having the books displayed as they would be actually be seen on a bookshelf. This allowed for an opportunity to add a secondary navigation system to these books, allowing users the ability to navigate to a specific book’s detail page by clicking on that book.</p><p>Adapting this desktop design for mobile devices, however, became the biggest challenge in the actual front-end development phase.</p><p>To solve the reflow problem for responsive design I completely changed the design of the homepage for certain breakpoints. In order to stay with the original intent of featuring just Jason's books, the design turned into a cover art layout.</p><div class="jason-solution animateOnce animatedParent"><div class="js-left divHeight animated slow fadeInLeft"><img src="images/jason-iPad-horizontal.jpg" alt="view of Jason's site on a tablet device"></div><div class="js-right divHeight animated slow fadeInRight"><img src="images/jason-iPhone-vertical.jpg" alt="view of Jason's site on a mobile device"></div></div></article><article class="before-and-after animatedParent animateOnce" data-sequence="300"><h2><span class="orange">Before &amp; After</span></h2><img class="animated fadeInUpShort" data-id="1" src="images/jason-original-site.jpg" alt="Jason's original homepage"> <a href="http://www.jasontheauthor.com" target="_blank" title="Link to Jason Cunningham's website"><img class="animated fadeInUpShort" data-id="2" src="images/jason-new-site.jpg" alt="Jason's new homepage"></a><article id="secondaryNav"><div id="local-nav"><a href="dr-he-spa.php" class="arrow left animsition-link" data-animsition-out="fade-out"></a><h3>View More Projects</h3><a href="bread-of-new-life.php" class="arrow right animsition-link" data-animsition-out="fade-out"></a></div><p><a href="index.php#portfolio">Back To Portfolio</a></p></article></article></section><footer><h4>&copy; 2015 Brent Leung</h4></footer><a href="#0" class="cd-top">Top</a></div>
